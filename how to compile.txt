Download the development SDL libraries available at LMS->OOP->Resources-> mingw_dev_lib64.zip

Extract the files in c:\


Now open VSCode and open folder where this SDLDemo is located

Run this command in the terminal

g++ *.cpp -IC:\mingw_dev_lib\include\SDL2 -LC:\mingw_dev_lib\lib -w -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_mixer -lSDL2_ttf

If there is no error, your program is compiled successfully, and a.exe is generated as output. Now run the program by this command:

a.exe

There will be error to execute it, as some files are missing. You have to copy all the files from c:\mingw_dev_lib\bin and paste them to your current folder.

Now execute the a.exe again.


If you are executing from command prompt rather than VSCode's terminal, then you have to execute this command:

g++ *.cpp -IC:\mingw_dev_lib\include\SDL2 -LC:\mingw_dev_lib\lib -w -Wl,-subsystem,windows -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image
